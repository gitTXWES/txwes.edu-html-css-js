<p>Considering a return to school to earn your master’s in computer science online? Obtaining an advanced degree can be a go-to path to new opportunities in this field while growing your skill set and building a stronger professional network.
</p>
<p>At the same time, completing a graduate program comes with its inherent challenges. On top of balancing work and study, you'll also need to navigate graduate-level coursework while staying motivated and managing your time effectively.
</p>With a little preparation and the right online computer science degree program, you can make the most of your distance learning experience.
<h2>Understanding the Demands of an Online CS Master’s Program</h2>
<p>A Master of Computer Science (CS) degree program in an online format is designed to equip students with the foundational skills and knowledge needed to advance in the computer science field. Although curricula are formatted to offer the flexibility and convenience students need to succeed, they should still be aware of the demands of an online degree program — particularly at the graduate level.
</p>
<h3>The Nature of Graduate-Level Coursework</h3>
<p>Compared to coursework at the undergraduate level, graduate-level classes are more complex and specialized, plus often go into more in-depth topics. Readings, assignments and exams may be more rigorous and demanding in nature, namely when navigating such complex computer science topics as:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Artificial intelligence (AI)</li>
<li>Machine learning</li>
<li>System architecture</li>
<li>Database systems</li>
</ul>
<p>With this in mind, even if you've completed some online classes in the past, tackling graduate-level coursework in a virtual learning environment may require additional academic discipline and personal organization skills.
</p>
<h3>Technical Requirements and Expectations</h3>
<p>Students preparing to enroll in an online Master of Computer Science degree program should also familiarize themselves with any technical requirements and other expectations before starting classes. At Texas Wesleyan University specifically, students need reliable access to a computer and internet connection to complete their required coursework. 
</p>
<p>For PCs (including tablets), minimum technical requirements include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Intel Core 5 (Intel Core 7 or better preferred)</li>
<li>Windows 10</li>
<li>16 GB of RAM </li>
<li>256 GB hard drive (SSD preferred)</li>
<li>Wi-Fi enabled</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p>For Apple computers, requirements include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Apple M1 or newer</li>
<li>Mac OS 12.7.1 or newer</li>
<li>16 GB of RAM </li>
<li>256 GB hard drive (SSD preferred)</li>
<li>Wi-Fi enabled</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p>Another note: While Chromebooks may be supported at Texas Weleyan, these devices typically cannot install or run additional applications that might be required as part of your computer science program. For this reason, a PC or Apple computer meeting the above specifications is strongly recommended over a Chromebook.
</p>
<h2>Time Management Essentials</h2>
<p>Successful time management for graduate students isn’t always straightforward, particularly for those who may already be working full-time jobs, taking care of a family or juggling other important obligations. Fortunately, with some digital learning best practices in mind, even the busiest of students can make time for their studies.
</p>
<h3>Establishing a Consistent Schedule</h3>
<p>In an online graduate degree program, obviously, it is imperative to work dedicated time into your schedule for school each week. How much time will you need? This ultimately depends on your courseload. However, the general recommendation is that you should set aside two to three credit hours of study time for each credit hour of class. 
</p>
<p>Once you have a better idea of how much time you must dedicate to schoolwork each week, you may be able to establish a schedule that works around your other responsibilities. Keep in mind, too, that online programs are versatile; if you have a particularly busy week at work, you may be able to scale back on your studies so long as you have a plan to catch up another week.
</p>
<h3>Utilizing Productivity Tools and Calendars</h3>
<p>There are plenty of productivity tools you can use to optimize your time management, including special techniques to make the most of the limited time you have to study. Many graduate students find that the so-called "Pomodoro method" is especially useful in maximizing productivity and focus. If you decide to go this route, try using one of the many free Pomodoro timers that are available online.

<p>A digital or physical planner will also be your sidekick in grad school. Taking the time to block out your work, study and personal time on an actual calendar will help you better plan your week and stay aware of impending deadlines.
</p>
<h2>Maintaining Self-Motivation</h2>
<p>When doing the majority of your learning and studying in a totally virtual environment, staying motivated and focused is essential. This is where some effective self-motivation techniques can come in, especially when you start to feel your own focus slipping.
</p>
<h3>Setting Clear, Incremental Goals</h3>
<p>As you embark on an online graduate program, using practical goal-setting frameworks to keep yourself motivated is one of the best distance learning tips to leverage. This includes setting smaller and more attainable goals for yourself throughout your program instead of focusing only on the big-picture goal of graduating. 
</p>
<p>For example, rather than setting an objective to earn an A in a particular class, you might focus more on short-term goals — like passing the next big exam or getting a good grade on a project. When big-picture goals are broken up into manageable parts, they may seem easier to achieve.
</p>
<h3>Tracking Milestones and Celebrating Achievements</h3>
<p>In addition to setting smaller goals for yourself throughout your course of study, you can maintain motivation by tracking and celebrating smaller milestones and achievements. Rather than waiting until you're walking across the stage at commencement to celebrate, why not treat yourself after your next big exam or the end of a semester? By celebrating small achievements throughout the course of your studies, you can keep yourself feeling engaged and energized.
</p>
<h2>Creating an Effective Study Environment</h2>
<p>When it comes to getting the most out of your study time, building an effective study routine in a distraction-free environment can make all the difference.
</p>
<h3>Designing a Distraction-Free Workspace</h3>
<p>Listening to online lectures and completing online coursework takes a great deal of focus. Unfortunately, it's easy to get distracted by phones, social media and other stimuli vying for your attention. Setting up a dedicated study area in your home enables you to minimize distractions and improve your productivity.
</p>
<p>To achieve this, try to set up a comfortable workspace that's free of distractions like televisions and phones. You might even consider putting your phone on "do not disturb" mode during your dedicated study time or leaving it in another room entirely while you work. 
</p>
<h3>Incorporating Ergonomics and Comfort</h3>
<p>You can also get more out of your study time by making sure you're physically as comfortable as possible. This may include purchasing an ergonomic desk chair with plenty of lumbar support, adjustable armrests and other features to prevent strain and discomfort. Likewise, building time for short breaks into your study sessions can help you stay comfortable and focused while cutting down on eye and muscle strain.
</p>
<h2>Balancing Work, Life and Academic Commitments</h2>
<p>Even with the best of intentions, balancing your work and social life with your academic commitments as an online graduate student requires commitment. Thus, it is critical to take the time to prioritize tasks and communicate boundaries.
</p>
<h3>Prioritizing Tasks and Responsibilities</h3>
<p>When you have a lot on your plate, knowing what to prioritize can be difficult. To aid with this decision paralysis, consider using a proven strategy like the Eisenhower Matrix to decide which items on your to-do list need to be handled sooner rather than later. Once you get into the habit of prioritizing your most urgent and important tasks, you may find it much easier to balance your responsibilities while maintaining a healthy work-life balance in the process.
</p>
<h3>Communicating Boundaries With Employers and Family</h3>
<p>Last but not least, be sure to connect with your family, friends and even employer to let them know about your plans to complete a graduate degree program. This will let them know that you'll have some extra responsibilities on your plate — and others are often happy to work with you to help lessen some of your burdens. For example, employers may be more flexible with your schedule and work hours while you're in school. Some may even offer tuition assistance, so don't hesitate to reach out and be prepared to accept help from others when needed.
</p>
<h2>Find an Online Computer Science Degree Program That Supports Your Work-Life Balance</h2>
<p>Balancing responsibilities as a graduate student in an online computer science program takes preparation, motivation and accountability. With the above tips in mind, however, you can cultivate productive study habits early on and set yourself up for academic success.
