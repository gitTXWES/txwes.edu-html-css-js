<h2>Overview of AI-Focused Coursework</h2>
<p>The core courses of Texas Wesleyan's online Master’s of Computer Science (MS) degree provide you with the foundation you need to progress in your technology career.
</p>
<h3>Core Concepts and Foundational Classes</h3>
<p>In 2022, Open AI co-founder and founder of the safe-AI startup Safe Superintelligence Inc. Ilya Sutskever posted, "It may be that today's large neural networks are slightly conscious." Other top AI researchers immediately disputed Sutskever's claim, which continues to be debated.
</p>
<p>Whether conscious or not, AI is revolutionizing all industries and many walks of life. Our graduate program in computer science — with the option to be completed in 12 months or 15 months — lays the groundwork for understanding the hardware, programming languages and theories underlying the AI revolution.
</p>
<p>Beginning with the Computer Networks and Principles of Software Engineering course, you'll also engage in independent learning and research in Computer Architecture, Operating Systems and Distributed Systems. This will provide a basis for understanding the diverse approaches that the AI industry is taking to implementing AI, machine learning (ML) and related technologies.
</p>
<p>Foundational courses offer a deep understanding of how AI systems run, before you advance to the technologies underlying large-scale data analytics, robotics and advanced AI/ML applications.
</p>
<h3>Advanced Machine Learning and Data Analytics</h3>
<p>In addition to courses on computer architecture and fundamental principles of software engineering, you'll dive into graduate-level courses in Machine Learning and Foundations of Algorithms.

<h3>Machine Learning Curriculum</h3>
<p>You'll dive into CSC 6420 - Machine Learning, which covers the math backbone of ML: probability theory, the basis of how algorithms aid in decision-making. The course will guide you through model selection and decision theory, too, enabling you to work through uncertain problems and select the best ML model for your purpose.
</p>
<p>Machine learning typically works with high-dimensional data, and the more dimensions of data that are involved, the greater the challenge in working with it (sometimes called the "curse of dimensionality”). The machine learning course will guide you through feature selection and other ways to help you overcome such challenges, as well as prevent overfitting or underfitting of models when analyzing complex, massive sets of data. Texas Wesleyan's graduate course in ML will also offer experience in linear regression and classification, essential concepts in the field.
</p>
<p>Additionally, you'll work with mixture models and expectation models, learning how to create algorithms for clustering or density. Graphical models such as Bayesian Networks and Markov Random Fields will also be covered, offering you tools for working with probabilistic reasoning and image processing. Finally, CSC 6420 offers a deep dive into neural networks and deep learning, with supervised learning that will allow you to experience applied machine learning.
</p>
<h3>Mastering Algorithmic Thinking</h3>
<p>CSC 6360, Foundations of Algorithms, has a core focus on the math and efficiency of algorithms, which provide the essential tools to process data and solve problems using machine learning and artificial intelligence.
</p>
<p>First, you'll learn about computational complexity and Big-O notation: limiting a function when the argument tends toward one specific value or infinity. Given the vast volumes of data involved in AI, these tools will offer you ways to optimize time spent performing various operations as well as space required for data. The course will also cover important strategies like sorting and searching through quicksorts and binary searches, how to break problems down through methods like divide-and-conquer and important optimization techniques (like Kruskal's algorithm).
</p>
<p>This course covers dynamic programming concepts like fitting the shortest paths into an optimal substructure and minimum spanning trees (MST). CSC 6360 balances theory offered by formal proofs with applications that enable you to implement algorithms efficiently in hands-on projects. Some of the applications, including deep learning algorithms, that rely on concepts you'll learn in this course include robotics, game AI and autonomous driving.
