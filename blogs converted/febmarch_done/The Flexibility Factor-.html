<p>A Bachelor of Business Administration (BBA) can open up doors to a range of opportunities in management, analytics, supply chain management and more. However, if you're looking for a remote BBA program that will allow you the freedom to complete your coursework online, a 100% online BBA program could be right for you.
</p>
<p>Offered with a number of specializations to suit your interests, this program empowers you to learn whenever and wherever is convenient for you. Before enrolling in any kind of online degree program, though, knowing what to expect and how to prepare is essential.
</p>
<h2>Understanding the Flexibility Factor in an Online BBA Program</h2>
<p>Online BBA programs are built for busy students who want to advance their education while still tending to other important obligations in life. As one of many 100% online degree programs offered at Texas Wesleyan University, for example, students can choose from concentrations in General Business, Management, Supply Chain Management and Business Analytics.
</p>
<h3>The Rise of Remote Learning</h3>
<p>While online degree programs are hardly a new concept, the increase in demand for remote learning has grown substantially over the past decade. This was particularly true at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, where many schools had no choice but to make the switch to online learning. During this time, advancements in learning management systems (LMS) and other technologies made it possible to deliver a quality learning experience remotely.
</p>
<p>According to the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), as of fall 2023, more than 53% of all postsecondary students were enrolled in at least one distance education course. This share of remote students remains high, despite showing a slight decrease from fall 2021 — when more than 9.4 million students (or about 61% of all undergraduate students) were enrolled in at least one online class. 
</p>
<h3>Benefits of Flexible Scheduling for Working Professionals</h3>
<p>There are two different types of online classes: synchronous and asynchronous. Synchronous classes "meet" during set days and times, either via video chat or some other live form of communication.
</p>
<p>Asynchronous classes, on the other hand, do not involve any live component. Instead, students have access to most (if not all) course material at the beginning of the semester and can then work entirely at their own pace. During the semester, there may be specific due dates and/or exam dates — but in general, asynchronous classes offer a much greater level of flexibility and convenience for online learners.
</p>
<p>For instance, Texas Wesleyan University’s online BBA classes are offered asynchronously, so our students can take advantage of flexible learning options and work your schooling around your busy schedule.
</p>
<h2>Mastering Time Management</h2>
<p>Although online classes offer added flexibility, they can also present challenges surrounding time management for students. If this will be your first time taking online classes (or if you've struggled with online classes in the past), knowing how to properly schedule and utilize your time can make all the difference.
</p>
<h3>Creating a Well-Structured Study Schedule</h3>
<p>One of the best tips students can keep in mind for managing their time while taking distance learning courses? Build out (and stick to) a set schedule each week. For every one credit hour of classes you're taking, plan to set aside at least two hours of studying each week. Many students find that using time-blocking techniques, or breaking the day down into blocks of time for specific tasks, can improve focus and motivation while staying on top of assignments and deadlines.
</p>
<h3>Leveraging Productivity Tools and Apps</h3>
<p>Additionally, plenty of free and paid productivity apps for students and other digital learners tools can help students get more done while balancing work and study. One free tool worth checking out is an online Pomodoro timer, which allows you to use the Pomodoro Technique to focus on one task for 20 minutes before taking a five-minute break. After completing a few Pomodoro sessions, a longer 10-minute break is added to the timer. Using one of these free timers can be a go-to method for minimizing distractions while staying on track.
</p><p>Students may benefit from other digital learning tools in online classes, too — including note-taking apps that will sync to all your devices as well as digital calendars and planning tools.</p>
<h2>Building Self-Discipline</h2>
<p>In addition to strong time management skills, students enrolling in an online degree program should have the academic discipline to stick to their plans and avoid distractions in their schoolwork. If you struggle with this aspect of online learning, a few goal-setting tips and best practices could help you overcome procrastination and minimize distractions.
</p>
<h3>Setting Realistic Goals and Milestones</h3>
<p>One motivation hack for online learners is to set realistic, attainable goals throughout their programs. Rather than setting the overarching goal of graduating from your degree program, for example, you might instead focus on the smaller steps you'll need to take to get there. This may include goals to pass your major tests and exams, earn a certain grade in a challenging class or even get through the semester without missing any assignments.
</p>
<p>By setting realistic goals with more achievable milestones that you can celebrate throughout the course of your program, you'll be able to keep yourself more motivated and focused on the big picture. When setting goals for school, try to keep the "S.M.A.R.T." acronym in mind. In other words, objectives should be:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Specific</li>
<li>Measurable</li>
<li>Attainable</li>
<li>Relevant</li>
<li>Time-bound</li>
</ul>
<h3>Overcoming Procrastination and Distractions</h3>
<p>Though online classes do offer more freedom and flexibility to complete your studies on your own schedule, some students may struggle with this independence. With fewer deadlines to keep you accountable, it can be tempting to procrastinate and become distracted during (what should be) study time. 
</p>
</div>
<div class="blog_article_column">
<p>This is where setting up a dedicated study space that encourages productivity can come into play. Ideally, you would have a quiet study space that you can use for all your online schooling — away from any distractions in your home and set up comfortably with ergonomics in mind. You might even consider making your workspace a "no-phone zone" or simply set your phone to "do not disturb" mode during your study time to sharpen your focus.
</p>
<h2>Maximizing Personal Productivity</h2>
<p>When you enroll in an online degree program with asynchronous classes, holding yourself accountable and optimizing your personal productivity is key to your long-term success. Below are some tips for getting into healthy study habits while leaning on the support of those around you: 
</p>
<h3>Developing Efficient Study Techniques</h3>
<p>Ultimately, every student's learning style is slightly different. Therefore, finding the study techniques that are best for you may be a matter of trial and error, to some extent. As you grow accustomed to your online coursework, make note of what kinds of study methods work best for you to minimize distractions and stay motivated. 
</p>
<p>For some, this may mean focusing on school later in the evenings after kids have gone to bed or after you've had time to decompress from a 9-to-5 work shift. Others may prefer to wake up with the sun and knock out their schoolwork before the day really gets going.
</p>
<h3>Building a Support Network of Peers and Mentors</h3>
<p>Pursuing an online degree program is easier when you have a strong support network of family, friends and other loved ones. However, peers and mentors in the form of fellow classmates, faculty and staff at your school can also make all the difference. At Texas Wesleyan University, we take great pride in our smaller class sizes that allow students to get the one-on-one attention and mentorship they need to make the most of their studies.
</p>
<p>By simply getting involved in your coursework through online class participation and attending professors' office hours when you need clarification or have questions, you can proactively build a support network that helps you thrive in an online degree program.
</p>
<h2>Balancing Work, Life and Academic Pursuits</h2>
<p>On top of an undergraduate education, many students in online degree programs are also juggling work, caring for a family and other responsibilities. 
</p>
<h3>Establishing Clear Boundaries and Expectations</h3>
<p>The good news is that following some practical work-life balance tips can help online students prioritize their mental health and well-being. This includes establishing clear boundaries at the beginning of your program and communicating openly with your family members, employers and others in your life about your goals.
</p>
<p>You might be surprised at how much the people in your life may be willing to help take some things off your plate while you're in school. Your employer, for example, may work to schedule your shifts during more convenient times around your other responsibilities. Family members may be willing to pick up some of the slack when it comes to chores around the house or running errands. The key, of course, is to be clear and open about your needs upfront.
</p>
<h3>Maintaining Health and Well-Being During the Program</h3>
<p>Stress can get the best of you when trying to juggle a variety of responsibilities at once, which is why following some best practices in stress management for students is crucial. As you block out time for school in your schedule, make an effort to also block out small amounts of time for self-care and other activities that will keep you feeling motivated. Likewise, take advantage of the resources your school has available for you, including counseling or an academic success center.
